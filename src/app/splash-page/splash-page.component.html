  <h2>Crypto crash course</h2>
  <p>
    CryptoCurrencies have been around since 1980, believe it or not. While they have thrived in various subcultures, it didn’t become a mainstream trend until bitcoin made its appearance. If someone had put $1 into bitcoin in early July of 2010 and sold it today, they would have $13,750,000 in the bank. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While trading cryptocurrencies is profitable, there is another aspect to this new wave of digital assets that many were not aware of. It is just as profitable, but a little more predictable. This is called mining. While the term seems a little confusing at first it’s actually a pretty simple concept. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Mining computers serve as auditors who don’t require pay or rest. When a crypto transaction is conducted, there needs to be some verification that it has happened. These transactions are added to a ledger after being verified using a measurably difficult algorithm. This ledger is called a blockchain. Every mining computer has a copy of the blockchain, and they all make sure nothing changes that shouldn’t. As a reward for verifying these transactions the parties who run the mining machines get a portion of the currency they are mining.
